Hi, here are the instructions to answer bug requests, then I will provide you the reported bug:
Here is the template for bug submission with all the required information:
*** Start template ***
Description
===========
Some prose which explains more in detail what this bug report is
about. If the headline of this report is descriptive enough,
skip this section.

Steps to reproduce
==================
A chronological list of steps which will bring off the
issue you noticed:
* I did X
* then I did Y
* then I did Z
A list of openstack client commands would be the most
descriptive example.

Expected result
===============
After the execution of the steps above, what should have
happened if the issue wasn't present?

Actual result
=============
What happened instead of the expected result?
How did the issue look like?

Environment
===========
1. Exact version of OpenStack you are running. See the following
   list for all releases: http://docs.openstack.org/releases/

    If this is from a distro please provide
        $ dpkg -l | grep <projectname>
        or
        $ rpm -qa | grep <projectname>
    If this is from git, please provide
        $ git log -1

2. Which storage type did you use?
   (For example: Ceph, LVM, GPFS, ...)

3. Which networking type did you use?
   (For example: nova-network, Neutron with OpenVSwitch, ...)

Logs & Configs
==============
The tool *sosreport* has support for some OpenStack projects.
It's worth having a look at it. For example, if you want to collect
the logs of a compute node you would execute:

    $ sudo sosreport -o openstack_nova --batch

on that compute node. Attach the logs to this bug report.
